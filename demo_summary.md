## Introduction

The debate surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated the software industry since the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022. Over this period, many within various sectors have weighed in on the disruptive potential of these technologies, frequently bypassing discussions on the inherent risks and merits they possess.

The lack of clear understanding around these new technologies has left organizations grappling with how to manage them, leading some to completely forgo their usage out of caution. Other companies, driven by the desire to remain on the cutting edge, tolerate certain risks or disregard security concerns entirely. Regardless of these differing approaches, the rise of generative AI is unstoppable, necessitating the need for secure implementation.

As generative AI rapidly evolves, companies eager to gain an upper hand often choose to keep their discoveries proprietary. However, this secrecy does not protect against the security challenges that daily advancements pose. Developers must be open to sharing insights gained through their experiences, particularly when this knowledge can inform and secure the threat landscape.

Large language models (LLMs), a prominent example of generative AI, are celebrated for their ability to generate text-based insights, suggestions, and more. This report will delve into how LLMs can be maliciously exploited, examine the ten most common vulnerabilities, and elucidate the mitigations available to ensure the safe use of LLMs.

## Securing Against LLM Abuses

### What is an LLM?

LLMs are foundational components of generative AI, which describes systems that can create text, code, audio, and video from user prompts. They can trace their origins to 2017 with the publication of "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., but gained significant traction following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

The application of LLMs has become a transformative force due to the establishment of user-friendly conversational interfaces, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 from OpenAI. These advancements are no longer confined to AI research labs and are now accessible via managed APIs and services offered by major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. 

The introduction of these technologies has spurred the proliferation of the open-source ecosystem, enabling generative AI integration into traditional applications. Consequently, public cloud providers are making proprietary models and a range of open-source solutions available to developers.

### Risks with LLM Implementations

Despite their potential, LLMs are not without risks. Here are some well-known vulnerabilities:

- **Hallucinations**: Occur when models generate inaccurate or nonsensical outputs, often due to biases in training data or model objectives.
- **Data Leakage**: Involves models inadvertently revealing personal or proprietary information, as they might memorize data from the training dataset.
- **Toxic Outputs**: LLMs can produce harmful or abusive language due to their training data's influence or security lapses.

### Responsible LLM Development

To ensure compliant and secure LLM deployment, developers and organizations must comprehend and mitigate associated risks. Techniques that bolster LLM resilience include:

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Employ adversarial training to identify weaknesses and enhance model security.
- **Managed Services and Tools**: Implement solutions that allow for secure "Bring Your Own Model" capabilities to minimize attack vectors.

## Common LLM Threat Techniques

LLMs introduce a new frontier of challenges that redefine how we perceive risk. Being prepared for this evolving threat landscape entails understanding the frequent attack techniques targeted at LLMs.

### LLM01 - Prompt Injection

This involves injecting malicious data into prompts to manipulate a model's outputs. Mitigations include prompt validation and response analysis to prevent exploit pathways.

### LLM02 - Insecure Output Handling

AI systems that inadequately manage outputs are prone to producing inappropriate or biased results. Solutions involve robust filtering and validation processes.

### LLM03 - Training Data Poisoning

This tactic exploits training data to degrade model performance or introduce biases. Proper validation and monitoring of training datasets are essential countermeasures.

### LLM04 - Model Denial of Service (DoS)

DoS attacks overwhelm models with requests, depleting resources and affecting availability. Solutions include rate-limiting and scalable infrastructure design.

### LLM05 - Supply Chain Vulnerability

Compromising the supply chain introduces vulnerabilities into development and deployment cycles. Ensuring data integrity and validating all stakeholder components are crucial.

### LLM06 - Sensitive Information Disclosure

Exploiting the model to leak confidential information is a significant risk. Mitigations include anonymizing datasets and query verifications to prevent exposure.

### LLM07 - Insecure Plugin Design

Insecure plugins can serve as entry points for attackers. Ensuring robust plugin evaluations and restrictive permissions can safeguard systems.

### LLM08 - Excessive Agency

Allowing plugins or systems too much autonomy poses risks. Solutions involve limiting permissions and enforcing human oversight over critical actions.

### LLM09 - Overreliance

Users leaning too heavily on AI-generated outputs, without scrutiny, can make flawed decisions. Training and transparency policies can alleviate overdependence.

### LLM10 - Model Theft

Theft involves unauthorized access or exfiltration of model data. Defense includes data-at-rest encryption and network segmentation.
